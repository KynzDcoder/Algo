# Algo
Here, i am writing some algorithms in java with some changes like taking commands from user. These algorithms are written by taking references from Princeton University.
The first problem is Dynamic Connectivity.
What is a Dynamic Connectivity Problem ?
Lets say you have 10 points and you want to connect them and find whether some points  are connected .
 So, the first algorithm is QuickFind Algorithm.
